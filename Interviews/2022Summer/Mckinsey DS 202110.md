## Preparation

### Role Specific

- Why McKinsey?

Firstly, McKinsey is a famous consulting company. I have heard a lot about the company. McKinsey's mission is to help clients make improvements in their performance. This way I could have more opportunities in real business problems. And I like to learn different business logics in different industries. Secondly, McKinsey has a good working environment, not only the benefits and compensation, but also the people. It's diverse and inclusive. Everyone working here could have a chance to contribute their ideas and make a difference.

- What team you want to work with?

I'd like to work in the Marketing and Sales team as a data scientist. Because firstly, I used to have some experience in marketing data science. In google I helped sales people build up a dashboard to reflect the market trend. And I think I could make impacts using some data science techniques in this area.

- Why Data Science? 

My undergraduate specialization was Environmental Data Analysis and Modeling. Through that, I found it was interesting to analyze data to make data-driven decisions. And through my internship in tech companies. I found I could make business impacts with data science techniques. That made me feel sense of achievement. Besides technical skills, data scientist should also have domain knowledge. Compared to software engineer, I could have more opportunities to learn about the business logic and collaborate with cross functional teams. I think this point attracts me a lot.

- What's the most difficult thing in data science?

I think the most difficult and challenging part is to identify the problem and translate business problems into data problems. Not all the business problems could be solved by data science techniques. For example, in Google, our business need is to find trending fashion words. And I translate the problem into finding most frequent fashion keywords on social media platforms. Then I start to collect data and make predictions. Actually, I spent a lot of time meeting with our sales team to learn about their thoughts and need because the most important thing is to make impacts for our business.

- What's the biggest problem you have been facing in Data Science

Identify the problem and find appropriate data for it. Not all the business problems could be solved by data science way. A data scientist should know how to translate business problems into data science problems. For example, I was an intern in Google China this summer...(dashboard building) 

- What's your favorite area in machine learning?

I think my favorite area is time series prediction and recommender system. Time series prediction helps us predict the future. Recommender System helps us personalize user experience. In google, my work is about market trends time series prediction. Through that, we could know the trending items in advance and make stock preparation. In that case, Our clients' products could have more impression and click on internet. And I also did a competition this summer, it's about short video recommender system...(Experience)

- Do you have experiences in image and text data?

Yes, I have taken some deep learning courses in school, and there are some course projects about image data, I did image classification in the project. The project is to classify the hand written digit and I used convolutional neural nets to do so. The accuracy is about 80%. For text data, in one of my summer internship in Google, I analyzed keywords frequency and dealt with text data. I introduced a word embedding vector in my prediction model and it showed good feature importance in the model.

- What neural nets have you trained?

Deep Neural Nets

Convolutional Neural Nets

Recurrent Neural Nets

- What kind of data you have modeled?

Time series data, text data, image data

- Explain deep learning to a 5-year-old child

I would say deep learning is like we human. It could extract information from image like we could watch. And it could extract information from text like we could read and listen.  Then we human may use the information we get to make decisions. Deep learning could do it too. It could make prediction based on the information it get. A machine could behave like human. That is what we called deep learning and artificial intelligence. 

### General BQ

- A time you persuade someone of something

The situation is that I was doing a data contest by China Computer Federation. My work was to predict the traffic congestion level by relevant data. Our team had 5 people. And when we met firstly, I told them that we could use traditional tree based model for prediction. One of my teammates said we should considered time series models instead. I disagreed with him and told my reason. And we decided to try our own models. Finally, it showed that my model performance was better than his. The best way to persuade others is to show them your result and prove it could work.

- A time you took risk and failed (a tight deadline)

The situation is that I was a research assistant in Tsinghua University. And my task was to design a new model for causal inference and submit my work to a top machine learning conference. Before my research, my mentor and I set up a goal to submit my paper on ICML 2021, and the deadline was Feb, 2021. However, this was a totally new area to me. It took a long time for me to get familiar with state-of-the-art causal inference work. Finally, I didn't make it. The learning is that I should set up a clear and reasonable goal at first. Besides that, I should also adjust my goal step by step. Finally, I submitted my paper in May, 2021.

- Your biggest failure (my paper didn't get accepted)

The situation is that I was a research assistant in Tsinghua University. And my task was to design a new model for causal inference and submit my work to a top machine learning conference. Firstly, did literature review ...(research). However, my work didn't get accepted by NIPS 2021. The reason is that my algorithm is too complicate to be efficient. And it's not a fit for large scale dataset. I learned from the experience that research is a hard work because you don't have reference. Besides that, for a researcher, it's always good to communicate with others. For example, in the second half of my research, I usually met with my supervisor and asked one of my teammates for help. And the process was faster than I did my work alone. It's always good to cooperate with others. And now I'm still trying to improve my work and submit it again someday.

- How do you approach ambiguous question

The situation is that I was a research assistant in Tsinghua University. And my task was to design a new model for causal inference and submit my work to a top machine learning conference. This task was too ambiguous for me because it's too broad. And I didn't have any background in causal inference before. What I do is to ask my supervisor about some basic causal inference fundamentals. And my supervisor gave me pieces of papers. I did literature review about that and know the research topic in causal inference now. I learned from this experience that if you came across a vague question, you should ask the experienced people for clarify and information. You can also search the questions on Google to get more information. When you have enough information, you could make decisions based on that.

- When you had competing priorities and a tough deadline approaching

The situation is that I was a data engineer at DiDi. My work is to help improve the efficiency of data pipelines. When I was doing my work. The product manager gave me another task that had tight deadline. The task was to analyze the recall ratio of frequent route. This task was important to make next steps plans. So I told my mentor about that. And I set aside my own project for a while and started to do this urgent and important task. Finally, I finished the product manager's task on time and continued to do my own project.

- A time you didn't get along with someone

The situation is that I was doing a data contest by China Computer Federation. My work was to predict the traffic congestion level by relevant data. Our team had 5 people. And when we met firstly, I told them that we could use traditional tree based model for prediction. One of my teammates said we should considered time series modeled instead. I disagreed with him and told my reason. And we decided to try our own models. Finally, it showed that my model performance was better than his. The best way to persuade others is to show them your result and prove it could work.

- Any project and any challenging problem? How did you solve it? 

I think my intern project in Google is quite challenging.

- Your strength

I think my strength is that I'm a quick learner. My undergraduate major was Environmental Engineering. It's not that data heavy. But when I found my passion through some course projects. I took initiatives to enroll in many statistics and programming courses and did internships in tech companies to strengthen my data skills. Now I think I have strong data science expertise to work as a data scientist.

- Your weakness

I think my weakness is trying to do everything best but ignore the priority of different tasks. Google (pipeline) ... My mentor told me that sometimes we don't have to do everything best. As an intern, I only need to do one project. But as a full time employee. They usually have a lot work to do. What they do is to meet the standard and expectation but not to do everything best. This way they could do more projects and make more impacts than only do one thing best. I think in the future I should have more experience on deciding priority of different tasks.

- Prefer research or engineering?

Engineering, by doing engineering, I could put my ideas into production and see the product. There is only little distance between my work and company's product. But for research, you need to wait a long time until your ideas become truth.
