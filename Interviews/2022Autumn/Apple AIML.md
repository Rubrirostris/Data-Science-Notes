## Introduction Call

My name is Jingxiang, and I'm currently a data science master's student at Columbia University. I found my passion for data science and machine learning through some research during my undergraduate. After that, I enrolled in many courses in machine learning and did many internships to learn about the industry. I was a software engineer in didi doing about route recommender system. I was a data scientist intern at Google doing market forecasting using machine learning. And this summer I did an internship as a data engineer in Amazon about data pipelines for downstream recommender systems. I like maching learning because of its power to know about the future from the past. And after graduation, I hope to be a machine learning engineer and continue my career in machine learning.
